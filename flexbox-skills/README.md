# Skills Test: Flexbox

This test is designed to check your understanding of how to use flexbox to achieve certain designs.
In each of the four tasks is a common design pattern that you might use flexbox to create. Your task is to build them.

These tasks were drawn from the [MDN Flexbox skills test](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox_skills). You can practice these tasks on their interactive site before completing them here, if you like.

## Task 1

In this task, the list items are the navigation for a site. They should be laid out as a row, with an equal amount of space between each item.

Your final result should look like the image below:

![Flex items laid out as a row with space between them.](task-1-solution.png)

Update the styles in `task-1/style.css` to complete the task.

## Task 2

In this task, the list items are all different sizes, but we want them to be displayed as three equal sized columns, no matter what content is in each item.

Your final result should look like the image below:

![Flex items laid out as three equal size columns with different amounts of content.](task-2-solution.png)

Update the styles in `task-2/style.css` to complete the task.

## Task 3

In this task, there are two elements in the HTML below, a <div> element with a class of parent which contains another <div> element with a class of child. Use flexbox to center the child inside the parent. Note that there is not just one possible solution here.

Your final result should look like the image below:

![A box centered inside another box.](task-3-solution.png)

Update the styles in `task-3/style.css` to complete the task.

## Task 4

In this task, arrange the items into rows as in the image below:

![A set of items displayed as rows.](task-4-solution.png)

Update the styles in `task-4/style.css` to complete the task.
