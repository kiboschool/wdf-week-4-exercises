# Profile Page Layout

## Introduction

In this project, you'll be creating a layout for your profile page. Now that 
you've added some styling, you should also make the layout a little more 
interesting while still making sure the content is legible.

## Instructions

**Before you get started**

Prepare what you'll need to build the site. Write down all of the facts and info you'll put on the website. You can use the file `site-plan.md` to take notes, or write things somewhere else. You can also use a whiteboard or pen and paper to draw your layouts out.

You'll be editing both the `index.html` and `style.css` files, so make sure you're adding the correct code in the correct file.

1. Add a navigation element with a list of three links, they can link to anywhere.
2. Using flexbox, make the list in the navigation inline
3. Decide how many columns you want your page to be (there has to be more than 
one column). Using CSS grid, implement your chosen number of columns.
4. Change the position of either the image element or one of the headings from 
static to fixed, absolute, sticky or relative. It should still make sense in 
the context of the page and flow well.

## Inspiration

Draw inspiration from your favourite websites, you can use this list as a starting point:

- https://www.swyx.io/
- https://safiyaunoble.com/bio-cv/
- https://www.tatianamac.com/about

## Rubric

Use this checklist to confirm that you've included everything you need:

- [ ] The navigation uses flexbox
- [ ] The navigation is an inline list
- [ ] Either the heading or image should **not** have static positioning
- [ ] You should have more than one column in the body

## Bonus

Make your columns responsive using only CSS grid and not media queries; i.e. on 
small screens your site should have only one column and on larger screens 
you should have more columns. 

Search for CSS grid `auto-fit` and `auto-fill` properties to find out how to do 
this.
