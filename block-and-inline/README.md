# Block and Inline

This task is to help you practice using the `display` property in CSS.

## Instructions

The inline element has a margin, padding and border already. 

However, the lines above and below are overlapping it.

What can you add to your CSS to cause the size of the margin, padding, and border to be respected by the other lines, while still keeping the element inline?

**Add styles to `style.css` to change how the span is displayed.**

After you are done, the box should look like this:
